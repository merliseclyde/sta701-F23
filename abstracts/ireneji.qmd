## Abstract 

Fault localization is a software testing activity that is critical when software failures occur. We propose a novel Bayesian fault localization method, yielding a principled and probabilistic ranking of suspicious input combinations for identifying the root causes of failures. We are currently developing methods to use the calculated probabilities for sequential test case generation.
