## Abstract 

Constraints on parameter spaces promote various structures in statistical and machine learning tasks. However, they present methodological and computational challenges. These challenges only become more evident in non-Euclidean settings. We advocate for the use of Projected Mirror Descent for constrained online estimation problems in many cases when the parameter space is non-Euclidean. We outline convergence properties of this algorithm and show how it can be connected to other algorithms of interest.
