    "text": "Description: This course provides graduate students with the opportunity to share their research with other students and faculty, as well as practice giving good research presentations. Each session will consist of either two short presentations or one long presentation. Presenters will receive constructive feedback from both myself and the audience, on both the presentation and research content. Students are encouraged (and expected) to contribute to discussions - this helps both the presenter and your own research!\nLogistics:\n\nSpeakers are expected to present in-person. A Zoom link will be available only for students who cannot physically attend or external audience members.\nStudents presenting will invite their PhD advisors and committee members to attend.\nAll PhD students in Statistical Science are recommended to register for STA 701S each semester, and all PhD students in Statistical Science in Years 3+ of studies will be required to register and present in STA 701S each year.\nThere will be two talks scheduled in each class. Each talk should be no longer than 25 minutes, which leaves ample time for questions & suggestions from the audience.\nFirst and second year PhD students will serve as Moderators, who will introduce the speakers and facilitate Q&A\nAny students who will need to change the date of the presentation should submit a Request in Github. Please provide the alternate date(s) and confirmation that the other individual is willing to switch.\nPlease submit titles and abstracts at least one week in advance."

    "title": "Prior-itizing Privacy: A Bayesian Approach to Setting the Privacy Budget in Differential Privacy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When releasing outputs from confidential data, agencies need to balance the analytical usefulness of the released data with the obligation to protect data subjects’ confidentiality. For releases satisfying differential privacy, this balance is reflected by the parameter \\(\\varepsilon\\), known as the privacy budget. In practice, it can be difficult for agencies to select and interpret \\(\\varepsilon\\). We use Bayesian posterior probabilities of disclosure to provide a framework for setting \\(\\varepsilon\\). The agency decides how much posterior risk it is willing to accept in a data release at various levels of prior risk. Using a mathematical relationship among these probabilities and \\(\\varepsilon\\), the agency selects the maximum \\(\\varepsilon\\) that ensures the posterior-to-prior ratios are acceptable for all values of prior disclosure risk. The framework applies to any differentially private mechanism.\n\n\nJerry Reiter"

We developed a tree boosting algorithm for learning conditional densities by forward stagewise fitting of an additive tree ensemble. The core idea of our algorithm is to use covariate-dependent probability measures defined by partition trees and sequentially “subtract” these probability measures from observations to remove the distributional structure from the underlying sampling distribution. Our algorithm offers the flexibility of employing any binary classifier trained under log loss to estimate branching probabilities within partition trees. The performance is further improved with scale-specific shrinkage. Notably, our algorithm not only allows evaluating the fitted density analytically but also provides a generative model that can be easily sampled from. We tested the algorithm on both simulated examples and a benchmark regression dataset.\n\n\nLi Ma"
